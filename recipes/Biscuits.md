Old fashioned biscuits made vegan
* Ingredients:
- 2 C Flour
- 2 T Sugar
- 2 tsp Baking Powder
- 1/2 tsp Salt
- 1/3 C Plant Based Butter (cubed)
- 3/4 C Ice Cold Water or Plant Based Milk

* Method:
1. Preheat oven to 350F.
2. Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.
3. Combine dry ingredient with plant based butter using a fork.
4. Add water/milk.
5. Knead until everything is mixed evenly.
6. Use rolling pin to flatten out down to desired thickness (1/4").
7. Cut out circular pieces.
8. Place on lightly greased baking sheet and bake for 30 minutes.

* note:
Keep the butter and water as cold as possible and try to handle dough
as little as possible. This will result in a flakier crust.
