Kategna
* Ingredients:
- 1 piece Injera
- 2-3 T Niter Kibbeh
- 1/2-3/4 tsp Berber Spice

* Method:
1. Divide the injera in half or into quarters, and in a skillet, heat the pieces until they
   become just a little crispy (just a little!).
2. Turn them frequently as you heat them.
3. Melt the kibbeh in a microwave.
4. Add the berbere to kibbeh and blend the well.
5. When the injera is ready, spread the spiced kibbeh onto the bubbly side of the injera
   like youâ€™re buttering bread.
