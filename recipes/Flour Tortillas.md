Soft flour tortillas
* Ingredients:
  - 300g Flour
  - 5g Salt
  - 35g Vegetable Shortening (or vegan butter)
  - Hot Water (Not Boiling)

* Method:
  1. Mix together flour and salt.
  2. Thoroughly combine dried ingredients with shortening.
  3. Add hot water until a dough ball forms.
  4. Knead dough ball for about 5 minutes until it become smooth and stretchy.
  5. Let sit for at least 20 minutes.
  6. Form into balls (size depends on what size tortillas you want).
  7. Roll out in to thin discs. They need to be thin enough to almost see through.
  8. Cook in a flat bottom pan on medium heat until the tortillas begin to
     puff up and then flip over and cook until the tortillas puff up again.
  9. Store in a towel, while the rest of the tortillas are being cooked.
